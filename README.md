## Big Data Definition
Big data refres to very large and diverse datasets that allow us to take a comprehensive approach to human analysis.
## Iris Dataset: UC Irvine Machine Learning
The Iris dataset was introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 and became essential for testing whether classification methods worked properly. Each row in the dataset represents an iris flower, and based on its sepal and petal measurements, the species can be determined. The three species are Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica, with a total of 150 flowers (50 from each species). The dataset includes four numerical features, sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, which are used to identify the species. Because the dataset is small, it is easy to compute and understand. This makes it a simple but powerful example of machine learning, where input features are used to train an algorithm to produce a target label. A trained machine learning model can use the four numerical features to predict a flowerâ€™s species. I chose this dataset because machine learning is the backbone of my research, and this simple example helps me better understand how it works.
