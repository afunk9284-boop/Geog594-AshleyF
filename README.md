## Big Data Definition
Big data refres to very large and diverse datasets that allow us to take a comprehensive approach to human analysis.
## Iris Dataset: UC Irvine Machine Learning
[Dataset link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)
The Iris dataset was introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 and became essential for testing whether classification methods worked properly. Each row in the dataset represents an iris flower, and based on its sepal and petal measurements, the species can be determined. The three species are Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica, with a total of 150 flowers (50 from each species). The dataset includes four numerical features, sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, which are used to identify the species. Because the dataset is small, it is easy to compute and understand. This makes it a simple but powerful example of machine learning application, where input features are used to train an algorithm to produce a target label. A trained machine learning model can use the four numerical features to predict a flower’s species. One of this dataset’s potential uses could be to try out different machine learning models and compare how well they classify the flowers. Every model works differently, so by testing them on this small dataset, you can easily learn their strengths and weaknesses. I chose this dataset because machine learning is the backbone of my research, and this simple example helps me better understand how it works.
## Featured Book
**Title:** *Data Science: Introduction*
**Author/Platform:** Wikibook
[Book link](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Science:_An_Introduction)
This is a beginner-friendly book that gives an all-encompassing overview of data science, including its history, how different disciplines collaborate, how to transform raw data into analyzable formats, and the important data types and platforms needed to be a successful data scientist. I find this book useful because I am just starting to enter the data science world, and it provides a very broad view of the field. I also like that it is openly accessible and can be updated, which is important since data science is such a fast-changing field.
